# Instructions

Implement a method that checks if a year is a leap year.
All the following rules must be satisfied:

A year is not a leap year if not divisible by 4
A year is a leap year if divisible by 4
A year is a leap year if divisible by 400
A year is not a leap year if divisible by 100 but not by 400

**Examples:**

1997 is not a leap year (not divisible by 4)
1996 is a leap year (divisible by 4)
1600 is a leap year (divisible by 400)
1800 is not a leap year (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by 400)
The method should return true if a year is a leap year, and false if it is not.

### Defining "Done"
How do you know when a kata is finished?

Firstly, it's not a one-shot thing. Some developers practice the same kata hundreds of times, each time trying a slightly new route, or a different technique.

Something that is important but sometimes overlooked is internalising the process of TDD. Try to always follow the principles while implementing the kata, even if it feels unnatural at first. If you get stuck and find you need to break one of the principles to get going again, that's fine, but make a note; it's an area for improvement. The next time you do the kata with more experience, you might find that it has taken care of itself.
